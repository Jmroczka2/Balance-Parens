Explanation for Grandma (Counter 2 Solution):
In order to know if the parentheses in the string are balanced or not, you'll need to traverse the string at least twice, once forwards and once backwards. However, before you begin, create an array (called `keep`) with elements equal to the characters in the string - this is important because strings are immutable in Javascript, so while traversing the string we want to be able to set characters to be removed if we find them to be out of balance. 
Starting with the forward pass, while traversing, `count` the number of open parentheses there are, and decrease this `count` by 1 for every close parentheses you find. If during the forward pass you find a close parentheses and the `count` at that moment is zero, then we know that the parentheses in question can be removed. After the forward pass is complete, the `count` at that time represents the amount of open parentheses out of balance (because we removed all the close parens that are out of balance, if there were any). Therefore, so long as the `count` is not zero, we can traverse from the right/end of the string and remove open partheses until the `count` becomes zero and we have our balanced string! Don't forget we need to actually remove the out-of-balance parens and return the string!
